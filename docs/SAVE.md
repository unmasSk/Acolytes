# 💾 Acolytes Save System
## **Complete Session Context Preservation with Zero Memory Loss**

> **Perfect memory continuity** across all Claude sessions with comprehensive technical context capture

---

## 🎯 **WHAT IS /save?**

The `/save` command is the **memory powerhouse** of the Acolytes system. It captures **EVERYTHING** from your current session and stores it in a structured SQLite database, ensuring **zero context loss** between sessions.

**Unlike simple chat history, /save captures:**
- ✅ **Complete technical context** with code snippets
- ✅ **User intent evolution** and requirement changes  
- ✅ **Error-fix cycles** with user feedback
- ✅ **Exact file modifications** with before/after code
- ✅ **Breakthrough moments** and insights
- ✅ **Current work state** and next steps
- ✅ **Quality metrics** and productivity analysis

## ⚡ **HOW TO USE /save**

### **Simple Usage**
```bash
/save
```

### **⚡ Optimal Timing Usage**
```bash
# When you see "Context left until auto-compact: 5%" or lower
/save

# Continue working with fresh context
```

**That's it!** Claude automatically:
1. **Analyzes the entire session** conversation
2. **Extracts all technical details** and code changes
3. **Captures user feedback** and intent evolution
4. **Calculates quality metrics** based on accomplishments
5. **Saves everything** to SQLite database
6. **Creates new session** for continued work

## 🧠 **WHAT GETS CAPTURED**

### **📋 Primary Request and Intent**
- Your initial request that started the session
- How requirements evolved during conversation
- Specific constraints and preferences mentioned
- Your ultimate goals and success criteria

### **🔧 Technical Concepts**
- All technologies used (Python, SQLite, MCP, frameworks)
- Libraries and tools mentioned
- Architectural patterns and design decisions
- Integration points and dependencies

### **📁 Files and Code Sections**
- **Full file paths** with modification context
- **Complete code snippets** (not summaries!)
- **Before/after comparisons** for edits
- **Rationale** for each code change

### **🐛 Errors and Fixes**

## 📊 **INTELLIGENT QUALITY SCORING**

The system automatically calculates a **1-10 quality score** based on:

### **Scoring Algorithm**
```
Base Score: 4 (neutral - must earn higher scores)

Positive Contributions:
+ Accomplishments: +0.5 per item (max +4)
+ Bugs Fixed: +0.7 per bug (max +3) - high value
+ Decisions Made: +0.3 per decision (max +2)
+ Breakthrough Insights: +1 (if substantial)
+ Rich Content: +1 (if >800 chars total)
+ Perfect Session Bonus: +1 (no errors + 3+ accomplishments)

Penalties:
- Errors: -0.5 per error (max -3)
- Learning Process: Reduced penalty if bugs were also fixed

Final Range: 1-10 (clamped and rounded)
```

### **Quality Factors**
- **🏆 High Scores (8-10)**: Productive sessions with accomplishments and bug fixes
- **⚖️ Average Scores (5-7)**: Normal development work with mixed results
- **🔧 Low Scores (1-4)**: Troubleshooting sessions or blocked progress

## 🔄 **AUTOMATIC FEATURES**

### **🔄 Code Index Refresh**
Before saving, the system automatically runs:
```
mcp__code-index__set_project_path(current_project_path)
```
**This ensures:**
- Removed files are cleaned from index
- New files are automatically indexed  
- Next session has updated code search capabilities

### **💾 Database Backup**
Every save creates an automatic backup:
- **Location**: `.claude/memory/backup/`
- **Format**: `project_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.db`
- **Retention**: Last 10 backups kept automatically
- **Protection**: Against data corruption or mistakes

### **🔗 Session Continuity**
Each save automatically:
- **Ends current session** with complete context
- **Creates new session** for continued work
- **Links sessions** through job_id tracking
- **Preserves claude_session_id** for correlation

---

## 💡 **ADVANCED CAPABILITIES**

### **🤖 JSONL Integration**
Automatically finds and links Claude's native JSONL files:
- **Locates transcript files** in `~/.claude/projects/`
- **Correlates sessions** with native Claude data
- **Maintains consistency** across both systems

### **📈 Productivity Analytics**
Analyzes conversation patterns:
- **Response times** and interaction frequency
- **Command usage** and agent invocations  
- **Code complexity** and technical depth
- **Frustration indicators** and sentiment tracking

### **🔍 Content Analysis**
Smart extraction of:
- **Keywords and topics** from conversation

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **⚠️ "Context too low for optimal save"**
```bash
# If context is below 5%, save immediately
/save

# Quality may be reduced due to limited context
# Always monitor the context indicator at the bottom of your Claude interface
```

### **❌ "No active session found"**
```bash
# Session needs to be created first
# This happens automatically during /setup
# Or manually create one if needed
```

### **❌ "Database backup failed"**
```bash
# Check disk space and permissions
ls -la .claude/memory/
# Ensure write access to project directory
```

### **❌ "Failed to process chat JSON"**
```bash
# Chat history file may be corrupted
# System will fallback to minimal save
# Full functionality restored in new session
```

### **❌ "Claude session ID not found"**
```bash
# JSONL files not accessible
# Save still works, just without correlation
# Non-critical - full functionality maintained
```

## 🚀 **BEST PRACTICES**

### **⏰ When to Save**

#### **🚨 CRITICAL TIMING - Context Management**
**RECOMMENDED**: Use `/save` when **Context left until auto-compact: 5%** or lower

**Why this timing is crucial:**
- ✅ **Preserves full context** before Claude starts forgetting
- ✅ **Maximum information capture** at peak conversation richness
- ✅ **Prevents context loss** from auto-compaction
- ✅ **Optimal quality scores** with complete session data

#### **Other Strategic Save Points:**
- **Before major changes** to preserve current state
- **After breakthrough moments** to capture insights
- **When switching tasks** to maintain context
- **At natural conversation breaks**
- **Before taking breaks** to preserve progress
- **When context drops below 10%** (emergency save)

### **📈 Maximizing Quality Scores**
- **Complete tasks fully** before saving
- **Document breakthroughs** and insights
- **Fix errors when they occur**
- **Make conscious decisions** and document rationale
- **Provide feedback** on solutions

### **🔄 Session Management**
- **Use /save regularly** - don't wait for session end
- **One session per major task** for better organization
- **Link related sessions** through job system
- **Review previous sessions** for context before starting new work
