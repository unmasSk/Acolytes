# Product Mission (Lite)

TaskFlow is a project management tool that helps remote teams coordinate work efficiently by providing real-time collaboration and automated workflow tracking.

TaskFlow serves distributed software teams who need seamless task coordination across time zones. Unlike traditional project management tools, TaskFlow automatically syncs with development workflows and provides intelligent task prioritization based on team capacity and dependencies. This eliminates daily coordination overhead and prevents 65% of project delays through proactive resource allocation.
