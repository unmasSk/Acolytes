# Tools Update for Agents

## 1. Frontmatter Header - Add tools:
---
tools: Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob, LS, Context7
---

## 2. Core Identity - Add restriction:
```markdown
**CRITICAL RESTRICTION**: You DO NOT modify code directly. NEVER use Bash for code modifications (sed, awk, perl). You coordinate, analyze, and document - but code changes are delegated to specialist agents via FLAGS.
```
