# üöÄ Jobs + Pull Requests Integration - Revolutionary Development Workflow

> **Game-Changing Integration**: Combine ClaudeSquad's intelligent Job system with GitHub Pull Requests for seamless context switching, parallel development, and team collaboration without losing progress.

## **ü§Ø The Vision**

Transform development workflow by integrating ClaudeSquad's **persistent Jobs system** with **GitHub Pull Requests**, enabling:

- **Seamless task switching** without context loss
- **Automatic branch management** per job
- **Smart PR creation** with job context
- **Perfect context restoration** when resuming jobs
- **Team collaboration** via job-specific PRs

---

## **‚ö° Proposed Workflow**

### **Scenario: Urgent Task Interruption**

```bash
# 1. Working on major feature job
claude "Working on setup system improvements"
# Current: job_setup_flow_complete (4 sessions, 80% complete)

# 2. Urgent security issue appears
claude "URGENT: Fix critical security bug in authentication"
# System automatically:
# - Pauses current job
# - Saves complete context to SQLite
# - Creates WIP branch + draft PR
# - Starts new urgent job

# 3. Create PR for security hotfix
claude "/pr create --title 'Critical auth security fix' --branch hotfix/security"
# System executes:
# - Creates focused branch from main
# - Commits security fixes
# - Creates production-ready PR
# - Gets reviewed + merged quickly

# 4. Resume original job seamlessly
claude "/job resume job_setup_flow_complete"
# System restores:
# - Exact branch state
# - File positions and context
# - Agent states and memory
# - SQLite job progress
# - Updates original WIP PR with progress
```

---

## **üî• Revolutionary Features**

### **1. Job-Branch Mapping System**

**New SQLite Schema:**

```sql
-- Job-Branch relationship tracking
CREATE TABLE job_branches (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    job_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    branch_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    pr_number INTEGER,
    pr_url TEXT,
    status TEXT CHECK(status IN ('active', 'paused', 'merged', 'abandoned')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    paused_at TIMESTAMP,
    resumed_at TIMESTAMP,
    context_snapshot TEXT, -- JSON with file positions, agent states
    FOREIGN KEY (job_id) REFERENCES jobs(id)
);

-- Enhanced jobs table
ALTER TABLE jobs ADD COLUMN current_branch TEXT;
ALTER TABLE jobs ADD COLUMN pr_number INTEGER;
```

### **2. Automatic PR Creation**

**Smart PR Management:**

```bash
# When pausing job - auto-create WIP PR
claude "/job pause --create-pr"
# System executes:
# 1. git checkout -b "job/setup-flow-$(date +%s)"
# 2. git add -A
# 3. git commit -m "üöß WIP: Job pause - setup flow improvements"
# 4. gh pr create --title "üöß WIP: Setup Flow Enhancements" --draft
# 5. Store PR info in job_branches table

# When resuming job - update existing PR
claude "/job resume job_setup_flow_complete"
# System executes:
# 1. git checkout job/setup-flow-1234567
# 2. Restore file positions from context_snapshot
# 3. Restore agent states and memory
# 4. Update PR description with progress
```

### **3. Context-Aware Branch Management**

**Perfect Context Switching:**

```bash
# Current job context saved with precision:
{
  "job_id": "job_setup_flow_complete",
  "current_files": {
    "setup.infrastructure.md": {"line": 142, "cursor": 25},
    "template-architecture.md": {"line": 89, "cursor": 0}
  },
  "agent_states": {
    "@setup.infrastructure": "analyzing database migrations",
    "@setup.codebase": "waiting for infrastructure completion"
  },
  "active_sessions": 4,
  "completed_tasks": 89,
  "pending_todos": ["Complete database analysis", "Generate architecture docs"],
  "git_state": {
    "branch": "job/setup-flow-1692847234",
    "last_commit": "abc123f",
    "staged_files": ["setup.infrastructure.md"]
  }
}
```

# 2. git push origin job/docs-revolution-1692840000
# 3. gh pr create --draft --title "üöß WIP: Documentation System Revolution"
# 4. Save complete context to SQLite job_branches table
# 5. Return to main branch for security work

claude "URGENT: Fix authentication bypass vulnerability in user login"
# System creates: job_security_auth_bypass
# New branch: hotfix/auth-bypass-fix-1692847234
```

### **Security Fix Development**

```bash
