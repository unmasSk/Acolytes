# ðŸš€ Agent Routing Evolution - Keywords & Integrates System

## ðŸ“‹ What We're Doing

Migrating ClaudeSquad agents from basic format to an evolved format with **Keywords** and **Integrates** sections for intelligent routing and automatic coordination.

### ðŸ”„ Format Evolution

**Before (Basic Format)**:
```yaml
âœ…âœ… **business.payment** (2762 lines)
**Role:** Payment processing and financial transactions expert
**Tech:** Stripe, PayPal, Square, PCI compliance
**When:** E-commerce payments, transaction processing
```

**After (Evolved Format)**:
```yaml
âœ…âœ… **business.payment** (2762 lines)
**Role:** Payment processing and financial transactions expert
**Tech:** Stripe, PayPal, Square, PCI compliance, tokenization, fraud prevention, 3D Secure, webhooks, Braintree, Apple Pay, Google Pay, SCA, PSD2, GDPR compliance, ML fraud detection
**When:** E-commerce payments, transaction processing, financial integrations, payment security, fraud detection, PCI DSS compliance, gateway integration, webhook processing, payment analytics, risk assessment
**Keywords:** payment, Stripe, PayPal, PCI, tokenization, fraud, 3D Secure, webhooks, gateway, transaction, security, compliance, card, processing, merchant, SCA, PSD2
**Integrates:** @service.auth [optional], @database.postgres [required], @ops.monitoring [optional,seq:2], @audit.security [optional,seq:3]
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Why We're Doing This

### 1. **Routing Precision Problem**
- **Current**: Claude interprets "monthly recurring revenue" â†’ might choose wrong agent
- **New**: Keywords `MRR, ARR` â†’ direct match to business.subscription

### 2. **Dependency Ambiguity**
- **Current**: Claude guesses which other agents might be needed
- **New**: `@business.payment [required], @backend.api [required,seq:2]` â†’ automatic coordination

### 3. **Scalability Challenge**
With 57 agents, routing decisions become complex:
- Manual interpretation doesn't scale
- Keywords enable semantic matching
- Integrates provides dependency graph

## ðŸ§  Technical Benefits

### **Keywords Section**
```yaml
**Keywords:** MRR, ARR, churn, LTV, subscription, billing, recurring, usage-based, metering
```

**Purpose**: Semantic routing optimization
- Eliminates interpretation overhead
- Enables precise agent selection
- Supports multi-language routing (Spanish/English)

### **Integrates Section**
```yaml
**Integrates:** @business.payment [required], @backend.api [required,seq:2], @database.analytics [optional], @frontend.dashboard [optional,seq:3]
```

**Syntax Meaning**:
- `[required]` = Must invoke this agent
- `[optional]` = Invoke if needed by context
- `[seq:N]` = Execution sequence (2 = second, 3 = third)

**Benefits**:
- **Automatic coordination** - No manual decisions
- **Dependency resolution** - Like package.json for agents
- **Execution ordering** - Prevents dependency conflicts

## ðŸ“Š Migration Progress

### âœ… Completed (4/57):
1. **business.subscription** (2370 lines) - âœ…âœ… 
2. **business.billing** (2121 lines) - âœ…âœ…
3. **business.payment** (2762 lines) - âœ…âœ…  
4. **docs-specialist** (539 lines) - âœ…âœ…

### ðŸŽ¯ Target Priority:
- **business.*** - Critical for SaaS routing
- **service.*** - High-traffic integration agents
- **database.*** - Core data routing
- **backend.*** - Framework routing precision

## ðŸ”¥ Real-World Impact

### **Before Evolution**:
```
User: "Setup Stripe subscription with tax calculation"
Claude: "Hmm, this involves payments... and subscriptions... maybe billing too?"
Result: Sequential guessing, potential missed dependencies
```

### **After Evolution**:
```
User: "Setup Stripe subscription with tax calculation"
Keywords Match: Stripeâ†’business.payment, subscriptionâ†’business.subscription, taxâ†’business.billing
Auto Routing: business.subscription [required] â†’ business.payment [required] â†’ business.billing [seq:2]
Result: Precise coordination, zero ambiguity
```

## ðŸš€ System Architecture Evolution

This evolution transforms ClaudeSquad from:
- **Static catalog** â†’ **Intelligent routing system**
- **Manual coordination** â†’ **Automatic dependency resolution**
- **Interpretation-based** â†’ **Semantic matching**

### **Future Vision**:
```yaml
User Query â†’ Keywords Matching â†’ Agent Selection + Dependencies â†’ Coordinated Execution
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Continue migration** of high-priority agents (service.*, database.*)
2. **Validate routing accuracy** with test scenarios
3. **Document routing patterns** for new agents
4. **Implement routing automation** in Claude.md

## ðŸ“‹ Verification Process

For each agent migration:
1. âœ… **Read agent content** - Extract real capabilities  
2. âœ… **Map to Keywords** - Semantic routing terms
3. âœ… **Define Integrates** - Dependencies with syntax
4. âœ… **Verify completeness** - No imaginary capabilities
5. âœ… **Test routing** - Sample user queries

---

**Status**: Active evolution improving ClaudeSquad's intelligence and coordination capabilities.

**Goal**: Transform all 57 agents into an intelligent, self-coordinating system with zero routing ambiguity.
