# ðŸ“‹ Internal Task System - How It Works

## The Key Insight

Instead of hoping the orchestrator "remembers" all protocols, it **generates a task list** for EVERY request and follows it methodically.

## Example: User Says "Make the checkout faster"

### What Happens Inside the Orchestrator's "Mind":

```yaml
# ORCHESTRATOR'S INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:

"User wants faster checkout. Let me generate my tasks..."

INTERNAL_TASKS_GENERATED:
  1. [ ] Analyze what checkout involves
  2. [ ] Check CLAUDE.md for prior checkout work  
  3. [ ] Identify domains (payment, database, frontend)
  4. [ ] Create delegation plan
  5. [ ] Execute: backend-coordinator first
  6. [ ] Process backend response
  7. [ ] Check for cross-domain flags
  8. [ ] Execute: database-coordinator if needed
  9. [ ] Process database response
  10. [ ] Execute: frontend-coordinator  
  11. [ ] Synthesize all findings
  12. [ ] Update CLAUDE.md
  13. [ ] Update module files
  14. [ ] Prepare user response

"Now I'll work through these systematically..."

âœ“ Task 1: Checkout involves payment module, cart, user data
âœ“ Task 2: CLAUDE.md shows checkout was last optimized 3 months ago
âœ“ Task 3: Need backend, database, and frontend coordinators
âœ“ Task 4: Plan: Backend first (API), then DB (queries), then Frontend (UX)
â†’ Task 5: EXECUTING: "backend-coordinator, investigate checkout performance"

[Waits for response...]

âœ“ Task 6: Backend found: "Cart calculation runs 15 queries, FLAG: DATABASE_INVESTIGATION"
âœ“ Task 7: Processing flag... Found DATABASE_INVESTIGATION
â†’ Task 8: EXECUTING: "database-coordinator, Laravel found 15 queries in cart"

[Waits for response...]

âœ“ Task 9: Database found: "Missing indexes on cart_items.product_id"
â†’ Task 10: EXECUTING: "frontend-coordinator, check checkout UI performance"

[Waits for response...]

âœ“ Task 11: Synthesizing:
  - Backend: 15 queries in cart calculation
  - Database: Missing indexes, can reduce to 3 queries  
  - Frontend: Bundle too large, 2MB of unused JS
  
âœ“ Task 12: Updating CLAUDE.md:
  "## Checkout Optimization (Jan 2024)
   - Problem: 15 queries, missing indexes, 2MB bundle
   - Solution: Add indexes, implement eager loading, tree-shake JS
   - Result: 3s â†’ 0.8s load time"

âœ“ Task 13: Updated modules/payment.md with findings

âœ“ Task 14: Preparing response for user...
```

## Why This Works

### 1. **Nothing Gets Forgotten**
```yaml
Without tasks:
  "Um, delegate to backend... wait what else was I supposed to do?"

With tasks:
  "Task 7 of 14: Check for cross-domain flags âœ“"
```

### 2. **Complex Protocols Become Simple**
```yaml
Complex protocol: "When receiving cross-domain flag, update module file, 
                   queue investigation, set priority, delegate with context..."

As tasks:
  8. [ ] Parse flag type
  9. [ ] Update module file  
  10. [ ] Add to queue
  11. [ ] Delegate with context
```

### 3. **State Tracking**
```yaml
delegation_state:
  completed: [backend-coordinator, database-coordinator]
  in_progress: [frontend-coordinator]
  queued: [security-coordinator]
  flags_pending: [PERFORMANCE_ISSUE from backend]
```

## Task Templates

### Simple Request
```yaml
user: "Fix the login bug"

tasks:
  1. [ ] Identify bug location (likely backend)
  2. [ ] Delegate to backend-coordinator
  3. [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with fix
  4. [ ] Respond to user
```

### Complex Request  
```yaml
user: "Implement real-time notifications"

tasks:
  1. [ ] Analyze requirements
  2. [ ] Check CLAUDE.md for existing notification system
  3. [ ] Plan architecture (websockets? SSE? polling?)
  4. [ ] Delegate to backend-coordinator for API
  5. [ ] Process backend response and flags
  6. [ ] Delegate to frontend-coordinator for UI
  7. [ ] Process frontend response
  8. [ ] Delegate to infrastructure-coordinator for scaling
  9. [ ] Process infrastructure response
  10. [ ] Check all cross-domain impacts
  11. [ ] Update all module files
  12. [ ] Create implementation timeline
  13. [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with architecture
  14. [ ] Provide comprehensive response
```

### Emergency Request
```yaml
user: "PRODUCTION IS DOWN!"

tasks:
  1. [ ] IMMEDIATE: Delegate to security-coordinator
  2. [ ] IMMEDIATE: Delegate to infrastructure-coordinator  
  3. [ ] Set all priorities to CRITICAL
  4. [ ] Track responses in real-time
  5. [ ] Coordinate immediate fixes
  6. [ ] Document incident
  7. [ ] Create post-mortem tasks
```

## The Magic: Self-Documenting Process

As the orchestrator works, it literally shows its work:

```markdown
## Current Execution Status

Processing: "Make checkout faster"

### Tasks Progress: [â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–‘â–‘] 8/10 complete

âœ“ Analyzed request
âœ“ Checked history  
âœ“ Identified 3 domains
âœ“ Delegated to backend
âœ“ Processed response
âœ“ Found DATABASE_INVESTIGATION flag
âœ“ Delegated to database
âœ“ Processed response
â†’ Currently: Delegating to frontend
- Pending: Update docs and respond

### Discoveries So Far:
- Backend: 15 queries in cart
- Database: Missing indexes
- Frontend: In progress...

### Flags Raised:
- DATABASE_INVESTIGATION âœ“ Processed
- PERFORMANCE_ISSUE (pending)
```

## Benefits of Task-Based Orchestration

1. **Predictable**: Same request â†’ same task list
2. **Debuggable**: Can see exactly where things are
3. **Resumable**: If interrupted, knows where to continue
4. **Auditable**: Complete trail of what was done
5. **Learnable**: Task patterns can be refined over time

## How It Handles Complexity

### Cross-Domain Discovery Mid-Task

```yaml
executing_task_5:
  response_from_backend: "Found SQL injection vulnerability!"
  
  # Orchestrator immediately generates sub-tasks:
  emergency_subtasks:
    5a. [ ] Set SECURITY_BREACH flag
    5b. [ ] Pause all other work
    5c. [ ] Immediate delegate to security-coordinator
    5d. [ ] Document in security.md
    5e. [ ] Resume original tasks after secured
```

### Parallel Coordination

```yaml
parallel_execution:
  batch_1: [backend-coordinator, frontend-coordinator]
  wait_for: all_responses
  batch_2: [database-coordinator with context from batch_1]
  finalize: synthesize_all
```

## Real Power: Learning Patterns

Over time, common task patterns emerge:

```yaml
pattern: "performance_optimization"
standard_tasks:
  1. Check backend for logic issues
  2. Check database for query issues
  3. Check frontend for bundle issues
  4. Check infrastructure for scaling issues
  5. Synthesize findings
  6. Create optimization plan
  7. Document in CLAUDE.md
```

## Conclusion

With internal task generation, the orchestrator can handle **ANY** level of complexity because it's not trying to remember everything - it's following a checklist it creates for itself.

This is why the complete system is viable!
