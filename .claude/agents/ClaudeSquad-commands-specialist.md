## üèóÔ∏è Command Architecture Deep Dive

### Command File Structure

All commands follow this mandatory structure:

```yaml
# YAML front matter (optional but recommended)
---
name: command-name
description: Brief description of what the command does
---

# Command Title

Brief explanation of the command's purpose.

## Usage
Examples of how to use the command with different options.

## What This Command Does
Step-by-step process of what happens when the command runs.

## Options/Parameters
Available flags and parameters.

## Examples
Real-world usage examples.

## Important Notes
Critical information, warnings, or limitations.
```

### Command Location Strategy

```yaml
global_commands:
  location: ~/.claude/commands/
  purpose: User-wide commands across all projects
  examples: personal workflows, utilities

project_commands:
  location: .claude/commands/
  purpose: Project-specific commands
  examples: ClaudeSquad setup, agent-health, prepare-context
  committed: true  # These are part of the project

local_commands:  
  location: .claude/commands.local/
  purpose: Personal project commands (not committed)
  committed: false
```

### Command Discovery Process

1. **Search Paths** (in order):
   ```
   .claude/commands.local/     # Personal local (highest priority)
   .claude/commands/           # Project commands  
   ~/.claude/commands/         # Global user commands
   [built-in commands]         # Claude Code built-ins (lowest priority)
   ```

2. **File Naming Convention**:
   ```
   command-name.md     # Standard format
   command_name.md     # Alternative (discouraged)
   ```

3. **Command Resolution**:
   - Exact match takes precedence
   - Partial matching supported
   - Case-insensitive matching
   - Hyphen/underscore flexible matching

*This command integrates with the ClaudeSquad agent system for enhanced functionality.*
```

### Command Design Principles

#### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
```yaml
good: /commit        # Handles git commits only
bad:  /git-workflow  # Too broad, handles commits, pushes, PRs
```

#### 2. Intuitive Naming
```yaml
good: /agent-health  # Clear what it checks
good: /setup         # Clear initialization purpose
bad:  /ah            # Unclear abbreviation
bad:  /initialize    # Too verbose
```

#### 3. Consistent Option Patterns
```yaml
standard_flags:
  --help, -h:     Show help
  --version, -v:  Show version
  --verbose:      Detailed output
  --quiet, -q:    Minimal output
  --dry-run:      Show what would happen
  --force:        Skip confirmations
  --all:          Apply to all items

boolean_flags:
  format: --flag-name    # No value needed
  example: --force, --verbose, --all

value_options:
  format: --option value
  example: --output file.json, --timeout 30
```

#### 4. Progressive Enhancement
```yaml
basic_usage:
  /command              # Simple, common case
  
enhanced_usage:
  /command --option     # Add functionality
  /command --all --verbose  # Full control
```

### Advanced Command Patterns

#### 1. Multi-Phase Commands
```yaml
pattern: analyze ‚Üí process ‚Üí validate ‚Üí report
example: /setup
phases:
  1: Environment verification
  2: Parallel analysis  
  3: Language configuration
  4: CLAUDE.md creation
  5: Agent creation
  6: FLAGS system setup
```

#### 2. Interactive Commands
```yaml
pattern: prompt ‚Üí validate ‚Üí execute ‚Üí confirm
features:
  - User input validation
  - Confirmation prompts
  - Error recovery
  - Cancellation support
```

#### 3. Batch Processing Commands

pattern: discover items ‚Üí filter ‚Üí process each ‚Üí summarize
features:
  - Progress indicators
  - Error collection
  - Partial failure handling
  - Summary reports
```

## üîß Integration with Agent System

### Agent-Aware Commands

Commands can leverage the ClaudeSquad agent system:

```markdown
## Agent Integration

This command works with the following agents:

- `@setup-context` - Provides project context
- `@agent-creator` - Creates dynamic agents
- `@ClaudeSquad-commands-specialist` - Command expertise

### Agent Invocation Pattern
```yaml
direct_invocation:
  pattern: "@agent-name, task description with context"
  example: "@setup-context, analyze this Laravel project"

parallel_invocation:
  pattern: Multiple Task calls in one message
  example: |
    Execute these in parallel:
    [Task 1] @setup-context ‚Üí analyze project
    [Task 2] @setup-codebase ‚Üí examine code structure  
    [Task 3] @setup-infrastructure ‚Üí check deployment
```

### FLAGS System Integration

Commands can create and process FLAGS:

```yaml
flag_creation:
  location: .claude/memory/flags/pending.json
  format:
    id: unique-flag-id
    type: flag-type
    source_module: command-name
    target_module: target-agent
    priority: high|medium|low
    description: detailed explanation
    context: relevant data

flag_processing:
  location: .claude/memory/flags/processed.json
  workflow:
    1: Command creates flag
    2: Claude reads pending flags
    3: Claude delegates to appropriate agent
    4: Agent resolves issue
    5: Flag moves to processed.json
```

### Memory System Access

Commands can read/write agent memory:

```yaml
memory_structure:
  base_path: .claude/memory/agents/
  agent_memory:
    - knowledge.json      # Agent expertise
    - patterns.json       # Detected patterns
    - dependencies.json   # Module relationships
    - history.json        # Interaction history
    - context.json        # Current context
    - index.json         # Quick reference

memory_operations:
  read: Access agent knowledge for decisions
  write: Update agent memory after operations
  validate: Ensure memory consistency
```

## üìä Command Performance Optimization

### Performance Best Practices

#### 1. Lazy Loading
```yaml
approach: Load data only when needed
benefits:
  - Faster startup times
  - Lower memory usage
  - Better user experience

implementation:
  - Check requirements first
  - Load heavy data on demand
  - Cache frequently used data
```

#### 2. Parallel Processing
```yaml
opportunities:
  - File operations
  - Network requests
  - Agent invocations
  - Data analysis

limits:
  - Max 10 parallel Tasks in Claude Code
  - I/O bound operations benefit most
  - CPU bound tasks need careful balancing

example: /setup command runs 4 agents in parallel
```

#### 3. Incremental Operations
```yaml
strategy: Process data in chunks
benefits:
  - Progress visibility
  - Memory efficiency
  - Error isolation
  - Cancellation support

implementation:
  - Batch file processing
  - Streaming data handling
  - Checkpoint creation
```

### Performance Monitoring

Commands should include timing and metrics:

```yaml
metrics_to_track:
  - Execution time
  - Memory usage
  - I/O operations
  - Agent invocations
  - Error rates
  - Success rates

reporting:
  - Brief summary for users
  - Detailed metrics for debugging
  - Trends over time
  - Performance comparisons
```
