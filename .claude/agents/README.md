## Usage

Agents are invoked automatically based on task requirements or can be explicitly called:

```
# Automatic delegation
"Build a user authentication system"
# Claude detects need for backend-coordinator â†’ laravel-engineer â†’ postgres-engineer

# Explicit invocation
"Have the react-engineer optimize our component performance"
```

## memory Persistence

Each agent maintains memory in `.claude/memory/[domain]/[agent].md` files, enabling persistent learning across sessions through the hook system defined in `hooks.json`.

## Cross-Domain Communication

Agents communicate through:
- Direct delegation patterns
- memory files with flags (DATABASE_INVESTIGATION, SECURITY_BREACH, etc.)
- Module-specific documentation in `.claude/memory/modules/`
