# Advanced Project Setup & Complete Configuration

I will perform a comprehensive analysis and setup of your development environment, covering everything from basic stack to security, deployment, and monitoring.

## Phase 0: Environment Verification

First, let me verify your development environment...

```yaml
Checking prerequisites:

Missing tools detected:
- [List of missing prerequisites]
- Installation commands provided
- Alternative solutions suggested
```

## Detection Phase

Analyzing project type (new vs existing)...

*[Checking for package.json, composer.json, requirements.txt, Gemfile, go.mod, .env, docker-compose.yml, and CI/CD configs]*

- "E2E tests configured but broken"
```

### Phase 3: Module Detection & Dynamic Agent Generation

Analyzing project structure to generate specialized agents...

```bash
# Step 1: Detect modules in the project
echo "üîç Scanning project structure..."

# Find main directories with substantial code
find . -type d -name "node_modules" -prune -o \
       -type d -name ".git" -prune -o \
       -type d -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 3 \
       -exec sh -c 'echo "$(find "$1" -type f \( -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.php" -o -name "*.py" \) | wc -l) $1"' _ {} \; \
       | sort -rn | head -20

# Step 2: Analyze each module
for module_path in backend/api backend/payments backend/auth frontend/components services/email; do
    if [ -d "$module_path" ]; then
        echo "üìä Analyzing module: $module_path"
        
        # Count files and lines
        file_count=$(find "$module_path" -type f -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.php" | wc -l)
        line_count=$(find "$module_path" -type f -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.php" -exec wc -l {} + | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}')
        
        # Detect main technology
        if [ -f "$module_path/composer.json" ]; then
            tech="PHP/Laravel"
        elif [ -f "$module_path/package.json" ]; then
            tech="JavaScript/Node"
        elif [ -f "$module_path/requirements.txt" ]; then
            tech="Python"
        else
            tech="Mixed"
        fi
        
        echo "  Files: $file_count | Lines: $line_count | Tech: $tech"
    fi
done

# Step 3: Generate dynamic agent for each module
echo "ü§ñ Generating dynamic agents..."
```

```python
# Dynamic agent generation using external template
def generate_dynamic_agent(module_name, module_path, analysis):
    """Generate a dynamic agent file for a specific module using template"""
    
    # Load the template
    template_path = ".claude/resources/templates/dynamic-agent-initial.md"
    with open(template_path, 'r') as f:
        template = f.read()
    
    # Prepare data for template
    template_data = {
        "module_name": module_name,
        "module_name_title": module_name.title(),

    }
    
    # Render template (using simple replacement for now)
    agent_content = template
    for key, value in template_data.items():
        agent_content = agent_content.replace(f"{{{{{key}}}}}", str(value))
    
    # Save to .claude/agents/
    agent_file = f".claude/agents/{module_name}-agent.md"
    save_to_file(agent_file, agent_content)
    
    print(f"‚úÖ Generated {agent_file}")
    return agent_file

def upgrade_dynamic_agent(agent_name, changes_detected):
    """Upgrade an existing dynamic agent when module changes"""
    
    # Load upgrade template
    upgrade_template_path = ".claude/resources/templates/dynamic-agent-upgrade.md"
    current_agent_path = f".claude/agents/{agent_name}.md"
    
    # Analyze what changed
    upgrade_data = analyze_changes(current_agent_path, changes_detected)
    
    # Apply upgrade template
    upgraded_content = render_upgrade(upgrade_template_path, upgrade_data)
    
    # Backup old version
    backup_path = f".claude/agents/backup/{agent_name}-v{upgrade_data['old_version']}.md"
    
    # Save upgraded version
    save_to_file(current_agent_path, upgraded_content)
    
    print(f"‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upgraded {agent_name} from v{upgrade_data['old_version']} to v{upgrade_data['new_version']}")
```

- Name: [Project Name]
- Type: [Application Type]
- Stage: [Development/Production]
- Version: [Current Version]

## ü§ñ Dynamic Agents Generated for YOUR Project

### Module-Specific Agents (Created by /setup)
These agents have deep knowledge of your specific modules:

1. **api-agent** 
   - Module: /backend/api
   - Expertise: Your REST endpoints, middleware, validation rules
   - Key Knowledge: 47 controllers, 23 middleware, 89 routes
   - Reviews: All API-related implementations
   
2. **payments-agent**
   - Module: /backend/payments  
   - Expertise: Your Stripe integration, invoicing, webhooks
   - Key Knowledge: PaymentService, StripeGateway, InvoiceGenerator
   - Reviews: All payment-related code
   
3. **auth-agent**
   - Module: /backend/auth
   - Expertise: Your JWT setup, OAuth2, 2FA, permissions
   - Key Knowledge: AuthController, JWTService, PermissionMiddleware  
   - Reviews: All authentication code

### Global Specialist Engineers (From ClaudeSquad)
These engineers implement based on dynamic agent guidance:

- **engineer-laravel**: Laravel implementation expert
- **engineer-react**: React development specialist
- **coordinator-database**: Database operations coordinator
- **testing-automation**: Test implementation specialist
- **auditor-security**: Security review specialist

## üîÑ Orchestration Workflow

When you request: "Implement OAuth in the API"

1. I consult **api-agent** for module context
2. api-agent provides conventions, patterns, existing auth
3. I instruct **engineer-laravel** with this context
4. engineer-laravel implements following api-agent's guidance
5. **api-agent reviews** the implementation
6. If issues found, engineer-laravel fixes them
7. Knowledge saved to project memory
